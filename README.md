## :bookmark: About 

The idea was presented by the faculty and I decided to implement it my way with different file structure and technologies.

This application aims to show users health agencies close to their geolocation. In the application it is possible to search for Hospitals, Health Centers and FIND. Also, it is possible to use the GPS to reach the chosen location.
